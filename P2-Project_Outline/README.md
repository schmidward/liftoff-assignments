# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Discover MO Trails is a web based application where users can search/discover local hiking trails in Missouri. 

### Features

- User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page with all their saved hikes, notes, interactitions on other trails etc. Maybe some kind of external OAuth too for FB/Google/Apple etc.

- Traffic: Users can see how long it'll take to get to a spot

- Geolocation: Users can see how close they are to a hiking spot

- Notes/Comments: Users can add comments or notes to a hiking trail for other users to see. These comments can be up or downvoted

- Weather: A nice to have, but including the forecast for what the weather will be like for the trail in the next few days

### Technologies

APIs for trail information and traffic information. Token for user geolocation. Security and persistance for user information

### What I'll Have to Learn

I will have to learn and implement a sophisticated user authorization and authentification framework. This will likely be Spring Security because of its documentation. This can also include learning how to implement OAuth too. 

If time permits, I will also learn how to implement a Weather API into the whole stack.
